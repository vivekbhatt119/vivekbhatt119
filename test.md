## Why You Should Not Use `>` or `<` for Floating-Point Comparisons in Magento

You **can** use `>` or `<` for comparing floating-point numbers in PHP, but the problem arises due to floating-point precision errors.  

### **Why Direct Comparison (`>`, `<`, `==`) is Problematic?**
Floating-point numbers in PHP (and most programming languages) are stored as **approximations**, not exact values. This can lead to unexpected results when performing arithmetic operations.  

#### **Example of Floating-Point Precision Issue**
```php
$value1 = 0.1 + 0.2; // Expected: 0.3
$value2 = 0.3;

var_dump($value1 == $value2); // false (unexpected!)
var_dump($value1 > $value2);  // true (unexpected!)
```
Even though mathematically `0.1 + 0.2` should be `0.3`, due to floating-point representation, it might be stored as `0.30000000000000004`, making direct comparisons unreliable.

### **How `FloatComparator` Fixes This**
Instead of direct comparison, `FloatComparator` allows you to specify a tolerance (`epsilon`), which ensures that small precision errors donâ€™t affect the comparison.

#### **Correct Way Using `FloatComparator`**
```php
use Magento\Framework\Math\FloatComparator;

$comparator = new FloatComparator();
$value1 = 0.1 + 0.2;
$value2 = 0.3;

if ($comparator->equal($value1, $value2)) {
    echo "The values are equal!"; // This will execute correctly
} else {
    echo "The values are NOT equal!";
}
```

### **Conclusion**
You should **avoid direct floating-point comparisons (`==`, `>`, `<`)** when dealing with calculations that involve decimal values (e.g., prices, tax rates, discounts) because of precision issues.  

Instead, use **`FloatComparator`** to ensure robust and accurate comparisons in Magento. ðŸš€
